    qd-quadtree
    ===========

    experiment to find the best q and d factors for a quadtree for
    efficiently determining the bounding triangle in triangle meshes,
    in terms of both memory usage and time required for lookup.

     - q => how many triangles in each subregion.
     - d => maximum quadtree depth.

    usage
    -----

        # first time
        $ make install
        $ make run
        $ open results.pdf

    what it does
    ------------

     - generate 2D mesh.
     - run the quadtree generation routine with desired qd factors
       and record total number of nodes in the tree.
     - record total no. of triangles scanned to locate 2000 points.
     - generate nice graphs.
